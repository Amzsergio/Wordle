# Wordle
This is an awesome game which got viral by New York times website. 
It's made with Javascript, and it was used next apis:
1. Random Words: To get ramdom words with length of 5 letters. < https://rapidapi.com/sheharyar566/api/random-words5/?utm_source=ANIA-KUBOW&utm_medium=DevRel&utm_campaign=DevRel >

2. This api is not still used, however soon I hope to merge it to the project:

At backend it was used Express, Cors and Axios libraries.
